# C-Comparc-Fundamentals

Learning C fundamentals for Computer Architecture and systems-level understanding.  
This repo documents basic C concepts and small practice programs while building core foundations.

## Progress Log

### Day 1
- Set up C compiler and VS Code extensions
- Learned basic `printf` statements in C

### Day 2
- Learned different data types in C and how to initialize variables
- Introduction to format specifiers
- Introduction to `if` statements

### Day 3
- Format specifiers (width, precision, flags)
- Arithmetic operators

-  [day1-3.c](Projects/day1-3.c)


### Day 4
- **Shopping Cart Program**
  - Built a simple interactive C program using concepts learned so far
  - Takes user input for:
    - food name (string)
    - price (float)
    - quantity (int)
  - Calculates and prints:
    - total cost
    - currency symbol
  -  [ShoppingCart.c](Projects/ShoppingCart.c)

### Day 5
- **Mad Libs Game**
  - Built a simple interactive Mad Libs–style game in C
  - Uses character arrays and `fgets()` for safe user input
  - Practices basic string manipulation (newline handling with `strlen`)
  - Generates dynamic story output using formatted `printf`
  - Focused on reinforcing C I/O, strings, and program structure
  - [MadLibsGame.c](Projects/madllibgsgame.c)
- **Math Functions Practice**
  - Practiced common C math library functions using `<math.h>`
  - Used functions such as `sqrt`, `pow`, `round`, `ceil`, `floor`, `abs`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`, and `tan`
  - Explored type behavior between integers and floating-point values
  - Reinforced understanding of standard libraries and numerical operations
  - [mathfunctions.c](Projects/mathfunctions.c)

### **Day 6**

- **Circle Calculator**
  - Built a C program to calculate circle properties using user input
  - Took radius as input and computed:
    - diameter
    - circumference
    - area
  - Practiced using `float` variables and math formulas
  - Reinforced correct use of constants and arithmetic expressions
  - [circleCalc.c](Projects/circleCalc.c)


- **Interest Calculator**
  - Created a simple interest calculator in C
  - Took user input for:
    - principal amount
    - interest rate
    - time period
  - Calculated total interest using mathematical expressions
  - Strengthened understanding of floating-point math and input/output formatting
  - [interestCalc.c](Projects/interestCalc.c)

- **Weight Converter**
  - Built a unit conversion program using conditionals
  - Converted weight between different units (e.g., pounds ↔ kilograms)
  - Used `if` / `else if` / `else` statements for user choice handling
  - Practiced validating user input and branching program logic
  - [weightConverter.c](Projects/weightConverter.c)


- **If Statements Practice**
  - Practiced conditional logic using `if`, `else if`, and `else`
  - Learned how program flow changes based on conditions
  - Reinforced comparison operators and logical structure
  - Improved control over decision-making in C programs
  - [ifStatements.c](Projects/ifStatements.c)
