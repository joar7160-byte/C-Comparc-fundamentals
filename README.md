# C-Comparc-Fundamentals

Learning C fundamentals for Computer Architecture and systems-level understanding.  
This repo documents basic C concepts and small practice programs while building core foundations.

## Progress Log

### Day 1
- Set up C compiler and VS Code extensions
- Learned basic `printf` statements in C

### Day 2
- Learned different data types in C and how to initialize variables
- Introduction to format specifiers
- Introduction to `if` statements

### Day 3
- Format specifiers (width, precision, flags)
- Arithmetic operators

### Day 4
- **Shopping Cart Program**
  - Built a simple interactive C program using concepts learned so far
  - Takes user input for:
    - food name (string)
    - price (float)
    - quantity (int)
  - Calculates and prints:
    - total cost
    - currency symbol
  -  [ShoppingCart.c](Projects/ShoppingCart.c)

### Day 5
- **Mad Libs Game**
  - Built a simple interactive Mad Libs–style game in C
  - Uses character arrays and `fgets()` for safe user input
  - Practices basic string manipulation (newline handling with `strlen`)
  - Generates dynamic story output using formatted `printf`
  - Focused on reinforcing C I/O, strings, and program structure
  - [MadLibsGame.c](Projects/madllibgsgame.c)
- **Math Functions Practice**
  - Practiced common C math library functions using `<math.h>`
  - Used functions such as `sqrt`, `pow`, `round`, `ceil`, `floor`, `abs`, `log`, `sin`, `cos`, and `tan`
  - Explored type behavior between integers and floating-point values
  - Reinforced understanding of standard libraries and numerical operations
  - [View source: mathfunctions.c](Projects/mathfunctions.c)
